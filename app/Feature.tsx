          Codes, smart bells or special door locks are a thing of the past. The
          Custo® smart mailbox opens by scanning the barcode on the parcel,
          without knowing it upfront! No more extra work (both for yourself and
          the courier) because, thanks to our 4G connection we can do the
          necessary (API) check, for +1500 couriers, before opening the door...

          We are all busy. That's why Custo® works for you, not the other way
          around. This allows you to free up more time for what really matters:
          family, friends, sports, hobbies, travel, ... Without stress or worry
          about missing a delivery. And last but not least, we also created a
          slot (on the side) for all your letters and newspapers....
